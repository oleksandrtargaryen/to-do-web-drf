# to-do-web-drf-react
A full-stack web application where each user has their own private ToDo list.  Built with Django and Django REST Framework for the backend API, React for the frontend,  Docker for containerization, and Swagger for API documentation.  Users can register, log in, and manage their personal ToDo items securely,  without seeing other users' data.
